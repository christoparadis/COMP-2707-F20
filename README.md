# Teaching tool for students with learning difficulties

Hello there! In light of Covid teacher are forced to teach at a distance, except for special needs students. 
Where special education teachers can pool together all notes, incident reports, and behavioral observations on a child’s educational progression to increase teaching performance and effectiveness.

## Scope
For teachers to keep track of a disabled student’s progress and effectively read the statistics pulled from submitted reports; to identify and minimize key obstacles in a student academic progress. The submitted reports are inputted into the database and then analyses through the website to pull related information between his/hers triggers and reactions along side the recommended procedures generated through the website.


## Website Design
Seeing that the audience who will be using the website will be older, I will be giving the website a simplistic layout. Utilizing color codes to differentiate the different pages and topics that can be accessed. All displayed information will be displayed through the use of tiles to create a clear division between displayed information (As displayed in the wireframes)
### Goal
To display and organize information in a minimalist style to create emphasis on information.

### Fonts
All fonts will be provided by google fonts to ensure identical display across all internet browsers. Libre Baskerville will be used for headers and Open Sans for body text. The pairing of fonts is to mimic a newspaper seeing that the website displays information in a serious nature.
